# Defensive Security Project

## Overview

In this group project, we worked in a team of two to design a custom monitoring environment to protect a fictional organization, VSI. The project was a part of the Defensive Security unit and involved using Splunk to research and design a monitoring solution.

The project was divided into three stages:

- **Stage 1:** Research and design a monitoring solution using Splunk for the fictional organization, VSI.
- **Stage 2:** Determine the effectiveness of the monitoring solution against simulated attacks.
- **Stage 3:** Prepare a group presentation showcasing the defensive project.

This project provided us with practical experience in designing and implementing a custom monitoring environment, and it emphasized the importance of teamwork in achieving project goals.
